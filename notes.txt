Begin left-recursion if you reach a call (inner) to a function call (outer) already in the call stack without making progress
Fail inner immediately
When outer returns
    Store the result
    Call the function again
    Run until to reach left-recursion condition again (inner)
    Pass inner immediately with stored result
    Repeat?
If outer fails
    ???
